# Onion-Chain-Messenger
This project is a functional, decentralized messaging application (dApp) that demonstrates the core principles of Web3. It uses an Ethereum smart contract to store messages on a blockchain, ensuring a tamper-proof and decentralized ledger. The front-end is built with React, allowing users to interact with the blockchain via MetaMask.
